# Datasets

A collection of dummy / public datasets for apps to use.

- [got_book1.csv](got_book1.csv): from [game_of_thrones_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/game-of-thrones-dataset/data?select=book1.csv)
- [data_scientist_jobstreet_scraped_v2.csv](data_scientist_jobstreet_scraped_v2.csv): from [Data Scientist Job Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azraimohamad/data-scientist-job-webscrape?select=data_scientist_jobstreet_scraped_v2.csv)

This repo hosts:

- Fake data. (Real data is usually in own sensible repo.)
- Medium-sized data. (GitHub isn't ideal for large data. Small data is too trivial to host.)
- Data used by multiple apps. (Single-app datasets should be in the app's repo.)
