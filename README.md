# Datasets

A collection of dummy datasets for apps to use.

This repo hosts:

- Fake data. (Real data is usually in own sensible repo.)
- Medium-sized data. (GitHub isn't ideal for large data. Small data is too trivial to host.)
- Data used by multiple apps. (Single-app datasets should be in the app's repo.)
